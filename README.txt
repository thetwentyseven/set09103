Hello Simon,

- Chapter 2: On the second chapter I finished and send to git the excersise

- Chapter 3: We are working on the redirections such as 404 errors, also geting 
             images from folders that also apply to any element that we want to
             get and display it on the screen

- Chapter 4: Creating request with POST, GET. Excercises about request.method

- Chapter 5: HTML Templates using Jinja2

- Chapter 6: Configs, session, flashing, logging and testing

- Chapter 7: Bootstrap

- Chapter 8: SQLite3. The firsts examples must be initiated with "python"
             through command lines. But the example with the line "for row in
             cursor.execute('SELECT rowid, *..." it is not working for me.
             However the example of working with flask is working fine. First
             we need to create "db_test.py", "init_db.py", and also have
             "schema.sql" and "sqlite3.db". the sqlite3 contains the database
             the schema overwrite the table into the database, the init_db
             initiate this process, and then db_test execute the program:
             insert the values and make a SELECT query to show it to the
             browser.
